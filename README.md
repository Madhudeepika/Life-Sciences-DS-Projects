### 1. Analysing Genetic Code
- This project demonstrates how to perform basic genetic code analysis using Python. It includes the following functionalities:

**Reading DNA Sequence:** Reads a DNA sequence from a text file (dna_sequence.txt).
**Calculating GC Content:** Calculates the GC content (percentage of G and C bases) of the DNA sequence.
**Translating DNA to Protein Sequence**: Translates the DNA sequence into a protein sequence using biopython library.
#### Files
**dna_sequence.txt:** Contains a sample DNA sequence for analysis.
**genetic_code_analysis.py:** Python script that implements reading DNA sequence, calculating GC content, and optionally translating DNA to protein sequence.
